Welcome to Calm Money. I hope this tool will bring you peace of mind about your personal finances. I think that most of the time we need as few as a comfortable way to input our expenses, an insight about how healthy our spending performance, how much more we can spend and some tool to answer the question "Can we afford this spending?".
